# snbank
This program implements the Python File system using basic banking system.
On run the program presents the user with two options(Staff Login and Close App). If user chooses the first option, user is made to enter login details(username and password). It accepts staff details (username and password) and compares same with  pre-defined username and password of the staff (saved in staff.txt file). If the both matches it gives the staff access, creates a session.txt file to save the user session and presents options for the staff to (create a new  bank account, check account details or log out).If it doesn't match it shows the user an error messgae and asks them to  try again.
If the staff chooses the first option(create new bank account) the program requests for (Account name, Opening balance, Account Type and Account email), the program generates a 10 digits account number after which the customer details  are saved in customer.txt file. The programe returns the options (create a new  bank account, check account details or log out). If the user chooses the second option, user is made to supply account number and the program fetches the customer's details.The program presents the user with the same options (create a new  bank account, check account details or log out), if the user selects the third option the program deletes the sessions.txt file and returns the user back to staff log in page. If the program chooses "close App", the program terminates.
